## Project Architecture Overview

This solution implements a **Clean Architecture** approach with a focus on separation of concerns. Each layer is independent and easy to modify, with a structure that supports scalability for future growth and changes. 
This project is responsible for reading an open API of Harry Potter spells, and then send the data to the HPSpells.API project to insert the data in the database.
